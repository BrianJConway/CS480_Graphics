# Example OpenGL Graphics Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 480/680 Graphics Class
Any students in that class follow the instructions at [**Github Setup**](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Github-Setup) to begin. This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.

Read through the Wiki on this repository to understand how each class works. This Wiki focuses on the code in PA1.

# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Orbiting and Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: Controllable Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. You can control the rotation with the keyboard and the orbit with the mouse. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3: Controllable Spinning Cube with Moon
This is a cube with a cubed moon that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. You can control the rotation of either or both with the keyboard and the orbits with the mouse. To run this project ```cd PA3``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA4: Model Loader
This is a model loader that works with .obj files. It loads the model data from a file, randomizes the colors of each vertex, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA4``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA5: Assimp Model Loader
This is a model loader that uses Assimp to load in .obj files. It loads the model data from a file, randomizes the colors of each vertex, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA5``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA6: Assimp Model Loader with textures
This is a model loader that uses Assimp to load in .obj files with textures. It loads the model data from a file, applies its specified texture, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA6``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA7: Solar System Simulation
This is a simulation of the solar system that uses Assimp to load in .obj files with textures. To run this project ```cd PA7``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA8: Bullet Physics Demo
This is a simulation of various objects interacting with bullet physics. It features a controllable cube, a sphere, and a static cylinder. To run this project ```cd PA8``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.
