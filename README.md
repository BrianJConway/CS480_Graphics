# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Orbiting and Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: Controllable Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. You can control the rotation with the keyboard and the orbit with the mouse. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3: Controllable Spinning Cube with Moon
This is a cube with a cubed moon that rotates around its y-axis and orbits the center of the screen. You can control the rotation of either or both with the keyboard and the orbits with the mouse. To run this project ```cd PA3``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA4: Model Loader
This is a model loader that works with .obj files. It loads the model data from a file, randomizes the colors of each vertex, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA4``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA5: Assimp Model Loader
This is a model loader that uses Assimp to load in .obj files. It loads the model data from a file, randomizes the colors of each vertex, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA5``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA6: Assimp Model Loader with textures
This is a model loader that uses Assimp to load in .obj files with textures. It loads the model data from a file, applies its specified texture, then slowly rotates the model. To run this project ```cd PA6``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA7: Solar System Simulation
This is a simulation of the solar system that uses Assimp to load in .obj files with textures. To run this project ```cd PA7``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA8: Bullet Physics Demo
This is a simulation of various objects interacting with bullet physics. It features a controllable cube, a sphere, and a static cylinder. To run this project ```cd PA8``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA9: Lighting
This is a modification of the last demo with basic lighting, allowing you to switch betweeen per-vertex and per-fragment lighting.

## PA11: Pinball
This is a simulation of a pinball machine, showcasing interaction, physics, and lighting.
